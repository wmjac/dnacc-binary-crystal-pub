Phase diagram calculations:
===========================

compute_spring_network.py:
Use this to create the data file harmonic-BCT.p.gz, which is needed by phase_diagram.py.  A summary of this information is placed in harmonic-BCT.dat for convenience.

phase_diagram.py:
Use this to compute the equilibrium BCT parameter for a pair potential, found in ../pair_potential_calculations/
